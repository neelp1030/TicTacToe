My very own implementation of TicTacToe as an Android app, made using Java and Android Studio. Learnt many different aspects of Android App development such as UI controls, activities, fragments, and layout options. For next steps, I plan on adding some unit tests and accomodation of the wide range of Android screen sizes (at the moment, the app is designed specifically for 5" screens). After these improvements, I will be publishing the app in the Google Play Store.

Screenshots of the App:
